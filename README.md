## What is Claude Board?

Claude Board is a self-hosted Kanban-style project management tool that integrates with AI coding agents. Create tasks, drag them to "In Progress", and agents autonomously write code, create branches, and commit changes &mdash; all while you watch the live terminal output.

Think of it as **Jira meets AI pair programming**: you define what needs to be done, agents do the coding, you review and approve.

## Features

### Orchestration & Planning
- **Multi-Agent Orchestration** &mdash; DAG-based dependency graph with visual mission control, drag-to-connect edges, and node repositioning
- **Planning Mode** &mdash; AI-powered task breakdown with DAG preview, review/approve/revise workflow
- **Roadmap & GSD Integration** &mdash; Milestones and phases with structured phase descriptions (Goal, Requirements, Success Criteria, Plans, Execution Order tables), PLAN.md task preview before task generation, and PROJECT.md / STATE.md overview for [GSD](https://github.com/bahri-hirfanoglu/gsd) spec-driven projects
- **Task Dependencies** &mdash; Multi-parent DAG dependencies with cycle detection and wave-based execution
- **Task Queue** &mdash; Auto-queue to chain tasks with configurable concurrency (1-50 agents)

### Execution & Testing
- **Live Terminal** &mdash; Watch agent tool calls, file edits, and bash commands in real-time with expandable cards
- **Project Terminal** &mdash; Unified tab that streams every active task's logs side-by-side with color-coded `[TASK-KEY]` per-line badges; split-grid mode gives each agent its own auto-scrolling pane
- **Split Terminal** &mdash; View multiple agent outputs side by side (vertical or horizontal split)
- **Auto Test** &mdash; Automatic verification of completed tasks &mdash; runs tests, checks acceptance criteria, auto-approves on success
- **Session Replay** &mdash; Timeline-based replay of agent actions with color-coded event types
- **Diff Viewer** &mdash; Unified diff display of code changes with syntax highlighting

### Project Management
- **Kanban Board** &mdash; Drag-and-drop tasks across Backlog, In Progress, Testing, Done
- **Multiple Views** &mdash; Board, List, Pipeline, Orchestration, Analytics, Roadmap, and Terminal views
- **Review System** &mdash; Approve completed work or request changes with revision feedback
- **Enhanced Dashboard** &mdash; Priority/model/type distribution, top-cost tasks, throughput metrics

### AI Configuration
- **Skill Import** &mdash; Browse and install skills from GitHub repositories (awesome-claude-code, etc.)
- **Roles** &mdash; Specialized agent personas with custom system prompts
- **Context Snippets & Prompt Templates** &mdash; Reusable rules, context, and templates with variable substitution
- **Codebase Scan** &mdash; AI-powered project analysis for better context

### Git & Integrations
- **Git Automation** &mdash; Auto-create feature branches and optional auto-PR creation
- **Webhook Notifications** &mdash; Send task events to Slack, Discord, Microsoft Teams, or custom endpoints
- **Manager Dashboard** &mdash; Manage MCP servers, plugins, agents, hooks, sessions, and settings

### Platform
- **Desktop App** &mdash; Native Windows, macOS, and Linux builds via Tauri v2 with auto-updater
- **Live Token Tracking** &mdash; Real-time token consumption and cost updates
- **Multi-Project** &mdash; Manage multiple projects with custom avatars and working directories
- **Model Selection** &mdash; Choose Opus, Sonnet, or Haiku per task with thinking effort levels
- **Mobile Responsive** &mdash; Full mobile support with touch-friendly controls

See the [Documentation](https://docs.claboard.dev) for detailed guides.
